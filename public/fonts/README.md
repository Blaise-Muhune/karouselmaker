# Caption font for video

Place a **TTF** font file here named `caption-font.ttf` so burned-in captions render reliably in the browser (FFmpeg.wasm). Same-origin avoids CORS issues.

If this file is missing, the app falls back to CDN URLs (e.g. Roboto). Download a TTF from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) (e.g. Roboto) and save it as `caption-font.ttf` in this folder.
